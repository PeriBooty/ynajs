{!Tag made by Pumper with lots of help from pankek, Lonestar*, and others}
{!Also this idea was inspired by pankek's pkmn tag So give them a lot of love! They've been a huge help}
;}{set:usage;Here's what I know so far!:
  **PET** - I pet the recipient - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me``
  **HUG** - I hug the recipient - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me``
  **CUTE** - I call the recipient cute - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me``
  **BOOP** - I boop the recipient - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me``
  **GOODNIGHT** - I say goodnight to the recipient - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me`` or ``pump``
  **CONVO** - I come up with a conversation topic - ``no args needed``
  **SHIP** - Cheap replacement for the ship tag - ``[Ship name]`` or ``[Person 1] [Person 2]``
  **GOODBYE** - Kinda like Goodnight, but with Goodbye instead - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me``
  **COOK** - I can try and cook for you - ``[Food]``
  **ANIMAL** - See what animal ~~RNG~~ RoboPump thinks you are - ``[Recipient]`` or ``me``
Or you can just say hi with ``+t {tag} hello``!;}{oneline:
